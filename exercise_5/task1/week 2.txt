Week 2 -04 Optimal alignments:

-Score = ratio of probablities
(relative likelihood the two seq. are evolutionary related as opposed to being unrelated) -> when 2 seq. have a common ancestor then we would expect that the similarity of these 2 sequences is high 
whereas law mafeesh similarity awi yeb2o unrelated

-Random model: "assuming the true model of explaining the origin of the two sequences"

-Joint probablity + all events are independent -> joint probability will be the product of the marginal probability

eqn: for every position i in the sequence we observe a certain letter, the letter occurs with the frequency q_xi and we multiply all these individual frequencies to estimate the probability -> first product reflect the assumption that every position is treated independently from other positions
same goes for q_yi

then the assumption that under the random model of both x and y all independent fe ba3do
therefore 1 big product of marginal probabilities.



Page 31
-in random model we have fully factorised distribution 
in the "match model" we have one type of independence assumption remaining which is the independence with regard to the positions, so 'i' again is the index defining the position in a sequence
no two separate probabilities just one joint probability

the joint probability of x and y under the match model eqn (1st eqn)



- 2nd eqn is odds ratio (if u take the ratio of both)


keda it is a multiplicative scoring scheme fa neroo7 lel additive scoring scheme by taking the log of 2nd eqn to give us 3rd eqn (sum of logarithms)

s(a,b) are then the values arranged in the substitution matrix, and the size of the substitution matrix will depend on the alphabet

mesh fahma el scores fel substitution matrix awi minute 13/14 bas elly fehemto: 
-elements have negative scores then random model dominates
-elements that have positive scores then match model dominates

position independent subs matrix that just score the occurunce of certain pair of letters in 2 different sequences

-gap penality functions

-linear do not work so well in practice because translation and transcription of mrna beyeb2a 3andohom fel 3ady gaps aktar fal penalty keda 3aly awi? (min 17)
linear time complexity

-affine function
scoring longer gaps not with a linear function 
2 parameters wa7ed for starting the gap wel tany for extending the gap

- convex
most appropriate model where each additional space contributes less than the previous space
- bas 3ando moshkela  in terms of computational complexity

Week 2 -05 Global alignments:

Page 34

-empty sequence is empty prefix: a sequence without any symbols
- F(i,j) is defined recursively under these specifying base conditions 

F(i,0)  we align the first i letters in the sequence x with 0 letters in sequence y  because  y is an empty sequence,
 so any letter in the first sequence will get aligned to a gap in the second sequence,
so we sum up the gap penalties we d is the gap length?
F(0,j) is prefix of sequence 'y' up to position 'j'

the optimal score for aligning 2 sequences
